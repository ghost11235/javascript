<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Ping Pong</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

<!-- The first thing I do whenever I create a new HTML file is to setup the
basic structure. The !DOCTYPE comes first, that tells the browser we're using
HTML5. The character set declaration of UTF-8 isn't strictly necessary, but it
plays nice with people in other countries. I give my page a title (shows up in
the title bar if the window, or in the tab handle of tabbed browsers), and then
finish up with a space defined for the body.

This is basically the bare minimum for getting a page together. You have to have
these tags, at the least, to satisfy the browser. The browser can make guesses
as to what you mean if you leave out the !DOCTYPE at the top and the meta tag
in the head, but you may not like the result.

If you are using Cloud9 right now, you can click the Preview menu item above and
you will see nothing but a blank, white screen.

The !DOCTYPE *must* be the first line in the file. Some browsers will trigger
themselves into a "quirks mode" if it isn't. There is a root <html> tag in which
everything goes. Other than the !DOCTYPE specification and this comment tag, the
HTML tag is the only tag that is allowed at the very top level.

Think of HTML tags as branches on a tree. Drawn as a graph, the document might
look like this:

!DOCTYPE                 html
    |                   /    \
    |                  /      \
  @html            head       body
                  /    \
                 /      \
               meta      title
              /            |
             /             |
         @charset     "Ping Pong"
            |
            |
          "UTF-8"

HTML tags start with an open angle bracket ( < ), followed by the tag name
( meta ), then any attributes that the tag might have ( charset ), and then
finished with a closing angle bracket ( > ). Some tags--such as the html, head,
title, and body tags--take internal content and so require an ending tag to
match their opening tag. The ending tag is similar to the opening tag in that it
starts and ends with angle brackets, with the exception that a forward slash ( / )
comes after the first angle bracket and before the name of the tag.

It's good practice to never overlap opening and closing tags. For example, the
tag for "bold" is <strong> and the tag for "italic" is <em>. If you want a mix
of bold and italic text, you might be tempted to use something like:

    <strong>just bold <em>bold and italic</strong> just italic</em>

Because the <em> tag was opened after the <strong> tag was opened, you should
close the <em> tag before the <strong> tag is closed. The above example is more
appropriately done (for the sake of tag nesting, not for the sake of styling)

    <strong>just bold <em>bold and italic</em></strong> <em>just italic</em>

If you work to try to do things the correct way, you will find fewer problems
with your code in the long run, and it will work for much longer. It's good to
experiment and break the rules when you're learning, but it's usually best to
take that learning and rework it to get it back in line with the standards.
